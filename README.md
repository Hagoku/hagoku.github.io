# Journal of Notes

The best way to learn is to organize ideas in such a way that makes sense to you. The second best, is to present those ideas for the scrutiny of others. This site is my personal means of doing just that--a designated place to develop and share my notes and thoughts.

I should note: nothing here is written from the perspective of an expert, but merely by a curious learner. I apologise in advance, for the poorly articulated and outright incorrect sections; they tend to appear.

Feel free to wander and share your thoughts. Enjoy your stay!
